        I'm a web developer specializing in building user-friendly websites, web
        apps and mobile apps. I greatly enjoy learning new technologies and have
        recently been building projects with Svelte/Sapper, Sanity, and
        serverless technologies like Firebase, Userbase, and Netlify. The latest
        addition to my programming toolkit is Typescript.

    <p class="text-2xl mb-2 leading-10">
        I'm currently interested in learning more about optomizing websites and
        apps for performance and Jamstack technologies.
